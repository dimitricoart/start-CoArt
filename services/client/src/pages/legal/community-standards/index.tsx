      <p>Effective Date: 15 November 2025</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Respectful Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          All users of Marketplace CoArt are expected to interact respectfully. Users must not engage in any form of
          bullying, harassment, intimidation, or abusive behavior towards other users, owners, or Marketplace personnel.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Non-Discrimination</h2>
        <p>
          Marketplace CoArt strictly prohibits any negative or prejudicial conduct, statements, or content based on
          race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, political affiliation, or
          any other protected characteristic under applicable law.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. No Frivolous or Malicious Claims</h2>
        <p>
          Users shall not submit frivolous, malicious, or unfounded claims or disputes against other users, owners, or
          the Marketplace. Claims should be made in good faith, based on verifiable facts and strong material evidence,
          not on rumors, speculation, or conclusory statements. Any claim that lacks factual support or is made
          recklessly may be considered defamation and will expose the user to potential legal action.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fact-Based Claims Only:</strong> Only claims that are strongly fact-founded and supported by
          verifiable evidence will be considered valid. Users must provide clear documentation, proof, or other material
          evidence for any reported dispute or allegation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Submission Procedure:</strong> Users must first submit any claims or complaints directly to the
          official Marketplace email address provided on the website. Only after submitting to the Marketplace and
          allowing reasonable time for review and response may the user escalate the claim to a third-party service
          provider or payment processor. Any failure to comply with this submission procedure will constitute a
          violation of these Community Standards and the Terms of Use, entitling Marketplace CoArt to claim damages for
          breach of agreement by the user.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Frivolous Claims to Third Parties:</strong> Users acknowledge that submitting any frivolous claim to a
          payment processor, third-party service provider, or other external party related to transactions on the
          Marketplace without first following the submission procedure constitutes a violation of these Community
          Standards. From the moment such a claim is submitted, Marketplace CoArt has the full right to initiate legal
          action against the user, including seeking damages, costs, and other remedies available under applicable law.
          The user agrees that this constitutes a material breach of these Community Standards and can be enforced in a
          court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>No False or Disparaging Claims:</strong> Users shall not make any false, sarcastic, misleading, or
          disparaging statements regarding Marketplace CoArt, its agents, representatives, or employees, whether
          publicly or privately. Claims of scam, misconduct, or other improper activity must be based on verifiable
          facts, submitted first to the Marketplace, and reported through the proper channels. Violation of this
          provision constitutes a material breach, giving Marketplace the right to take legal action and seek damages,
          costs, and other remedies.
        </p>

          upon copyrights, trademarks, or other IP rights of others is strictly prohibited.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Reporting Violations</h2>
        <p>
          Users are encouraged to report any behavior that violates these standards. Reports can be submitted through
          the designated channels on the Marketplace platform. The Marketplace will review reports and take appropriate
          action, including warnings, account suspension, or termination, depending on severity.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Enforcement and Consequences</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Marketplace CoArt reserves the right to remove content, suspend accounts, or restrict access for violations
            of these standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Severe or repeated violations may result in permanent account termination and prohibition from future use of
            the platform.
          </li>
          <li>Marketplace may escalate serious violations to appropriate authorities if required by law.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forfeiture of User Rights:</strong> In exceptional situations, the Marketplace reserves the right to
            forfeit or revoke any and all rights, privileges, or access granted to a user if the user engages in
            prohibited behavior described in these Community Standards. Such forfeiture is at the Marketplace’s sole
            discretion and may include removal of digital claim rights, denial of participation in transactions, or
            other remedies deemed necessary to protect the platform and its users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Liquidated Damages:</strong> Any negative, prohibited, or malicious behavior by the user, including
            violations of Sections 3 and 4, will constitute liquidated damages to the Marketplace, notwithstanding any
            fees previously collected (such as the $10,000 fee). The Marketplace may seek such liquidated damages in
            addition to any other remedies available under applicable law.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Liquidated Damage Standard Clause:</strong> Users acknowledge that the harm caused by violations of
            these Community Standards may be difficult or impossible to quantify in advance. Liquidated damages
            represent a reasonable estimate of potential harm and are not intended as a penalty. By using the
            Marketplace, users agree that any liquidated damages claimed under these Standards are fair, reasonable, and
            enforceable under applicable law.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

          By using Marketplace CoArt, users agree to comply with these Community Standards. Continued use of the
          platform constitutes acknowledgment and acceptance of these rules.
