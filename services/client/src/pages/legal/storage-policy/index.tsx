        <span>1. Purpose and Scope</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          This document sets out CoArt Marketplace&rsquo;s operational policy and seller delivery requirements relating
          to the responsible storage of physical collectible objects that are listed, sold, or fractionalized on CoArt
          (&quot;Objects&quot;). It describes the marketplace&rsquo;s standard practices, the obligations sellers accept
          when listing Objects, the role of Fractional Crypto Certificates (&quot;FCC&quot;), the 50% payment threshold
          mechanism, and how CoArt coordinates with independent third&#8209;party storage providers (&quot;Storage
          Partners&quot;).
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          This Policy is intended for publication on CoArt&rsquo;s website and applies to all users and listings unless
          otherwise specified. Certain seller obligations described below are binding when accepted by the seller at
          listing; other provisions describe non&#8209;binding marketplace practices and procedures. Specific storage
          arrangements are governed by separate written storage agreements between the seller (or owner) and the Storage
          Partner, or by a separate storage agreement with CoArt where applicable.

      <h2>
        <span>3. FCCs, Provenance and Listing Preconditions</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          When an Object is first uploaded to CoArt by its initial uploader (the &quot;seller&quot;), CoArt will
          generate an FCC that records identifying data and initial provenance information. The FCC and its blockchain
          registry are used to track transfer history and to assist with future authentication. Objects that have not
          been issued an FCC cannot be displayed in CoArt showroom listings.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>3.1 Seller Representations</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          By uploading an Object for FCC creation and listing, the seller represents and warrants that the seller has
          lawful title and the right to sell the Object. The seller must confirm this representation by checking the
          required confirmation checkbox at upload. If requested by CoArt, the seller must provide any supporting
          documentation evidencing title, provenance, or export/import permissions.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>3.2 Expert Review</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          Objects may be subject to a preliminary expert review of up to forty&#8209;eight (48) hours conducted by CoArt
          or by an independent expert community cooperating with CoArt. CoArt may refuse FCC creation and listing if the
          Object fails review or is otherwise inconsistent with CoArt policy or Community Standards. CoArt&rsquo;s
          decision on pre&#8209;listing eligibility is final for marketplace listing purposes.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>4. Seller Delivery Obligation and Cooperation</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>The seller agrees to cooperate with CoArt and Storage Partners as follows.</span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>4.1 Confirmation at Upload</span>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            The seller must confirm ownership and sale rights via the upload confirmation checkbox. Without such
            confirmation the Object will not proceed to expert review or FCC issuance.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            If the seller confirms but does not immediately provide supporting documentation, CoArt may still permit
            expert review; the seller remains fully responsible for the truth of the confirmation.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <span>4.2 Trigger Event &mdash; 50% Threshold</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          When the 50% Threshold is reached, CoArt may request that the seller deliver the Object to a Storage Partner.
          Upon such request, the seller shall:
        </span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Object to the Storage Partner within fourteen (14)
            calendar days;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Provide necessary documentation, including but not limited to provenance records, invoices, export/import
            permits, and evidence of insurance as required by the Storage Partner;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Coordinate with CoArt and the Storage Partner to arrange logistics, verification, and acceptance procedures.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <span>4.3 Delivery Failures</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          If the seller refuses or materially fails to deliver the Object to the Storage Partner after the 50%
          Threshold, CoArt may take one or more remedial actions, at its discretion, including removing or suspending
          the Object&rsquo;s listing, freezing fraction sales, notifying purchasers, or restricting the seller&rsquo;s
          account. These remedies are in addition to any other rights CoArt may have under its Terms of Use or
          applicable law.

        <span>5. Storage Partners and Storage Process</span>
      </h2>
      <h3>
        <span>5.1 Types of Storage Partners</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          CoArt may utilize one or more of the following storage infrastructures depending on the Object and
          transaction: regional warehouses, secure vaults, bonded warehouses, or international freeports (for example,
          Geneva, Riga, or other suitable facilities).
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>5.2 Storage Agreement</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          Storage is governed by a storage agreement between the seller (or owner) and the Storage Partner. CoArt may
          facilitate introductions, documentation, and coordination but is not a party to the storage agreement unless
          explicitly stated in writing.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>5.3 Acceptance and Verification</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          Upon delivery to a Storage Partner, the Storage Partner will perform acceptance checks to verify that the
          Object corresponds to FCC metadata and that it meets agreed condition standards. Acceptance by a Storage
          Partner is conclusive for storage purposes subject to the Storage Partner&rsquo;s inspection report and the
          storage agreement&rsquo;s terms.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>5.4 Movement Between Facilities</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          CoArt may arrange, or the storage agreement may permit, movement of Objects between Storage Partners for
          operational, insurance, security, or compliance reasons. CoArt will use reasonable efforts to notify relevant
          parties of any planned movement, but notification is not guaranteed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>6. Costs, Insurance and Allocation</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Storage, insurance, transport, customs, handling and related fees are allocated according to the listing
          terms, the storage agreement, or applicable fractionalization agreements.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>6.1 Typical Allocation</span>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Costs of initial delivery to the buyer (including shipping and transit insurance) are typically borne by the
            buyer in accordance with the listing terms.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Costs of storage and ongoing insurance to protect fractional holders are typically borne by the seller or by
            the fractional holders collectively as set out in the fractionalization agreement.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Indicative storage costs for freeport or vault services are often in the range of c. 2&ndash;2.5% per annum
            of appraised value; actual rates vary by facility.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <span>6.2 Insurance Requirements</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          CoArt or the Storage Partner may require that the Object be insured for an agreed value either by the seller
          or under the facility&rsquo;s insurance scheme. Proof of insurance may be required prior to acceptance.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>7. Fractionalization and FCC Fractions</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Objects may be fractionalized through the FCC structure. By default an FCC may contain 10,000 dormant
          fractions, unless a custom fraction structure is agreed at issuance. Fractionalization mechanics (voting
          thresholds, full-sale offers, dissolution events) are governed by the FCC documentation and any separate
          fractionalization agreement.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>7.1 Majority Sale and Full Ownership Transfer</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          If an entity acquires a qualified majority of fractions (for example, 95% or another threshold specified in
          the FCC documentation), that entity may request coordination with CoArt for transfer of the physical Object to
          the majority owner in accordance with the FCC rules and any applicable agreements. CoArt may require the
          Object to be held in independent storage prior to, and during, any transfer process to protect fractional
          holders.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <span>7.2 Marketplace Participation and Fee Allocation</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          When fractionalization occurs, CoArt and the seller may agree that CoArt will retain a specified percentage of
          fractions (for example, 3% of issued fractions) and, where applicable, the right to act as responsible
          custodian for the Object if the marketplace holds the necessary storage agreement. Details must be set out in
          a separate agreement between CoArt and the seller.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>8. Liability and Limitations</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          CoArt does not accept liability for the Object&rsquo;s condition, loss, damage, theft, or disappearance except
          to the extent expressly agreed in a specific storage agreement signed by CoArt. CoArt is not a storage
          custodian merely by facilitating introductions or requesting delivery; custody and liability are governed by
          the storage agreement between the seller and the Storage Partner.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>9. Remedies for Non&#8209;Compliance</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Failure by a seller to comply with delivery and cooperation obligations after the 50% Threshold may result in
          remedial actions by CoArt, including but not limited to removal of the listing, freezing of fraction
          transfers, notices to purchasers, account restrictions, or other measures permitted under the Terms of Use.
        </span>
