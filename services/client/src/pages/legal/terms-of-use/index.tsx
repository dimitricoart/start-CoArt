      <h1>Marketplace CoArt — Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: 11 November 2025</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Scope &amp; Commercial Relationship</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern all access to and use of Marketplace CoArt
          (&quot;Marketplace&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;), including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tokenized Blue Chip Art Objects sold via Fractional Crypto Certificates (&quot;FCC&quot;) representing
            digital claim rights and economic participation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other items sold as a whole, which convey legal ownership and title through a separate sales contract.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Business-to-Business (B2B) Relationship:&nbsp;By using the Marketplace to acquire FCC or to purchase objects
          as a whole, you represent and warrant that you are acting in a commercial or business capacity (not as a
          consumer) and that your transactions are for resale, investment, or other business purposes. The parties
          acknowledge that these Terms are negotiated and agreed between sophisticated commercial actors and that
          consumer-protection remedies do not apply to B2B transactions to the extent permitted by law.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Role of the Marketplace</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Intermediary only.&nbsp;Marketplace acts solely as a non&#8209;custodial intermediary listing FCC and
            full-object items and providing a blockchain registry for recording FCC transfers.
          </li>
          <li>
            No ownership (except whole-object buyers).&nbsp;Marketplace CoArt does not own the underlying objects.
            Whole-object buyers acquire legal ownership directly from the real-world owner via a separate sales
            contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Protection under EU law.&nbsp;The Marketplace operates under the European Union E&#8209;Commerce Directive
            and benefits from intermediary protections.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. FCC &mdash; Blockchain, Recording &amp; Object Identification</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Recording of Rights</h3>
        <p>
          The Marketplace maintains a blockchain registry to record and track digital claim rights. All transfers and
          changes of ownership rights or fractional ownership of assets are automatically recorded in a transparent
          manner and are accessible to all interested parties, without revealing private information of participants.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Verification Purpose Only</h3>
        <p>
          The blockchain registry may be used to verify claim rights, but it does not constitute a comprehensive title
          examination and cannot be used to assert legal ownership of the underlying items.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Object Identification</h3>
        <p>
          Fractional Crypto Certificates (&quot;FCC&quot;), a unique development of the Marketplace, contain data
          necessary to verify the authenticity of the object when required, eliminating the risk of substitution of the
          physical asset during the trading of ownership rights on the online marketplace.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 FCC Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Each FCC is designed so that, at the code level, it can include as many indivisible fractions representing
          partial claims on the underlying asset as needed. By default, 10,000 fractions are created for each FCC. Until
          an object with FCC is made available for fractional ownership through purchase of these fractions, the
          fractions remain inactive and do not interfere with any prior sales or resales of the same asset as a whole.
        </p>

        <h3>3.5 Rights Conferred by FCC</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Economic participation.&nbsp;FCC holders may receive a proportional share of certain proceeds (e.g., resale
            or licensing) as defined by Marketplace and object owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transferability.&nbsp;FCC Units are transferable subject to Marketplace rules, applicable law, and
            smart-contract constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verification.&nbsp;Holders may verify authenticity and transfer history via the Marketplace blockchain
            registry.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.6 Rights Not Conferred</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>FCC do not&nbsp;confer legal title, deed, or other proprietary right in the physical object.</li>
          <li>
            FCC do not&nbsp;confer voting, governance, fiduciary, or managerial rights over the object, owner, or
            Marketplace.
          </li>
          <li>FCC do not&nbsp;guarantee the object is free from encumbrances, liens, or claims.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Purchases of Full-Object Items</h2>
        <p>
          Where an item is sold as a whole, the sale is governed by a separate sales contract. Full-object purchasers
          acquire title and ownership upon completion of sale, subject to all contractual conditions, payment, and
          transfer formalities specified by the seller. The Marketplace facilitates listing and transmission of
          information only.
        </p>
        <h2>16. Expert Engagement &amp; Reliance</h2>
        <p>
          Marketplace CoArt may engage independent experts, appraisers, or professionals (&quot;Experts&quot;) to
          provide attestations, valuations, authenticity verification, or other advisory input regarding Objects or FCCs
          listed on the Marketplace. Users acknowledge that any information, opinions, or statements provided by such
          Experts are relied upon by the Marketplace and by Users for informational purposes only.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Marketplace, Users agree that they rely on the testimony, reports, or assessments of Experts at
          their own risk and understand that Marketplace does not independently verify or warrant the accuracy of such
          information. Marketplace shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or discrepancies in expert reports or
          advice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Payments, Fees & No Custody</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All payments are processed by third-party providers; Marketplace does not act as custodian or escrow unless
            a separate written escrow agreement exists.
          </li>
          <li>Marketplace may deduct commissions and fees as disclosed.</li>
          <li>
            No Guaranteed Refunds.&nbsp;Refunds are not guaranteed. Refunds may be considered case-by-case at
            Marketplace&rsquo;s sole discretion, without creating precedent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consideration and Obligation to Pay.&nbsp;The provision or transfer of FCC or full-object items constitutes
            full, good, and valuable consideration paid by the user. From the moment of transfer or issuance, the user
            owes the purchase price, even if payment fails to reach the Marketplace for any reason, including disputes,
            technical issues, or delays in the payment processor. This obligation is of the essence of the contract.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Representations & Warranties</h2>

          By using the Marketplace, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old, have authority to
          enter into these Terms, are not on sanctions lists, and will comply with all applicable law. If acting on
          behalf of an entity, you have authority to bind it.

      <section>
        <h2>7. No Title Examination, No Warranty, As-Is</h2>
        <p>
          The Marketplace does not perform comprehensive title, provenance, or lien searches. All FCC and full-object
          items are provided as-is, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
          warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, marketability, or title. Sole representations
          as to ownership or title are those provided by the real-world owner.

        </p>
        <h3>8.4 Independent Contractors</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, employment, or fiduciary relationship. Parties are
